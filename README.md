## Content

We provide a Jupyter Notebook with all the code and the images where we provided short explanations about the code and the functions. 
The official report can be found in the pdf file where we answered all the questions and provided the most important figures and images.

All needed packages can be found in the environment.yml file and can be installed directly.
